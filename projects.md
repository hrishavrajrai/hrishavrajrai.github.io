Aircraft flies with the help of many electronic components like *servo motors*, *simple propeller motor*, *electronic speed controller (ESR)*, *transmitter*, *receiver*, etc. This project helped in understanding the theory behind the functioning of an aircraft and also sheds light on aircraft design.

### 2) Multi-Purpose Agriculture Machine 

A project about building a mechanical machine that serves multiple purposes. It is used in agriculture to reduce time and money invested in planting crops. The project uses *gear mechanism* to transmit power from one shaft to another. It has four different parts, the first part looks into digging soil, the second part focuses on dropping seeds, the third part takes care of spreading water and the last part aims at covering the seed.
